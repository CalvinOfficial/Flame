Flame is a modpack designed as an **OptiFine alternative**. It includes most of OptiFine's features, such as built-in shader support, major improvements in rendering and logic performance, additional features for resource packs to use, zoom features, OptiFine and custom capes support, and [more](https://github.com/CalvinOfficial/Flame/wiki/Give-up-OptiFine).
